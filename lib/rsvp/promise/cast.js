/**
  `RSVP.Promise.cast` returns the same promise if that promise shares a constructor
  with the promise being casted.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  var promise = RSVP.resolve(1);
  var casted = RSVP.Promise.cast(promise);

  console.log(promise === casted); // true
  ```

  In the case of a promise whose constructor does not match, it is assimilated.
  The resulting promise will fulfill or reject based on the outcome of the
  promise being casted.

  In the case of a non-promise, a promise which will fulfill with that value is
  returned.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  var value = 1; // could be a number, boolean, string, undefined...
  var casted = RSVP.Promise.cast(value);

  console.log(value === casted); // false
  console.log(casted instanceof RSVP.Promise) // true

  casted.then(function(val) {
    val === value // => true
  });
  ```

  `RSVP.Promise.cast` is similar to `RSVP.resolve`, but `RSVP.Promise.cast` differs in the
  following ways:

  * `RSVP.Promise.cast` serves as a memory-efficient way of getting a promise, when you
  have something that could either be a promise or a value. RSVP.resolve
  will have the same effect but will create a new promise wrapper if the
  argument is a promise.
  * `RSVP.Promise.cast` is a way of casting incoming thenables or promise subclasses to
  promises of the exact class specified, so that the resulting object's `then` is
  ensured to have the behavior of the constructor you are calling cast on (i.e., RSVP.Promise).

  @method cast
  @param {Object} object to be casted
  @return {Promise} promise that is fulfilled when all properties of `promises`
  have been fulfilled, or rejected if any of them become rejected.
